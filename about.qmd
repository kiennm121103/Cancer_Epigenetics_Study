## About This Project

This Cancer Epigenetics Study website showcases interactive data analysis tools built with R, Shiny, and modern web technologies.

## Purpose

The goal is to demonstrate:

1. **Reproducible Research**: Using R and Quarto for transparent analysis
2. **Interactive Visualization**: Creating engaging data exploration tools
3. **Modern Deployment**: Leveraging Shinylive for browser-based apps
4. **Open Science**: Sharing tools freely via GitHub Pages

## Technology

### R and Shiny
- **R**: Statistical programming language
- **Shiny**: Framework for interactive web apps
- **ggplot2**: Grammar of graphics for elegant visualizations

### Shinylive
Shinylive allows Shiny apps to run entirely in the browser using WebAssembly. This means:
- No R server required
- Free hosting on GitHub Pages
- Instant loading (after initial assets)
- Works offline after first load

### Quarto
Quarto is a scientific publishing system that:
- Combines narrative text with code
- Renders to websites, PDFs, presentations
- Supports multiple languages (R, Python, Julia)
- Integrates with Shinylive for embedded apps

## Dataset

The **Palmer Penguins** dataset was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. It's an excellent alternative to the classic Iris dataset for data science education.
